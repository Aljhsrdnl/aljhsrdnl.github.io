            <span class="ms-5">With</span> the continuous spreading and evolution of the COVID-19 is the ceaseless resiliency of man. We have learned to adjust to the new normal despite the insufficiency of resources for us to cope up. A student learns to adjust to his new class environment, releases his innate creativity to comply with his requirement, and takes extra care of himself to improve his immune system. <br>

            <span class="ms-5">In</span> order to play bowling, it requires facilities such as lane length, width, surface, and pin deck. Moreover, such activity needs equipment such as shoes, pins, and balls. As a 2nd-year college student taking up PE 113, it is a requirement to play bowling. This has unleashed my innate creativity to look for alternatives. The only difficulty I have encountered is the lack of space to play bowling since it requires a large sum of space. Luckily, the length of our living room to our dining area is enough for me to practice and play bowling. I was able to come up with an alternative for the bowling pins and the bowling ball. Ten 500 mL water bottles were used as pins filled with pebbles and old school socks were utilized to create a bowling ball. <br>
            <span class="ms-5">COVID-19 </span> has adversely affected every sector in the country especially the academe in which the transition of face-to-face classes to online classes took place. The poor internet connection and signal made it worse for students especially those who are living in rural areas just like me. I have to walk roughly 1.5 km for me to get to a place with a stable signal. This set-up was hard for me because it is tiring both mentally and physically. However, after a month, I was used to it and I saw the benefits of walking. I was able to exercise daily and my endurance has improved greatly. Also, I do not have to worry about my daily Physical Activity Log (a requirement in PE 113) because I get to exercise every day. <br>
            <span class="ms-5">During </span> the pre-COVID-19 pandemic, it was already hard to maintain or become physically fit due to hectic schedules, the discipline needed, and other alike circumstances. Today, it has even become harder to achieve such goal due to the effects COVID-19 has brought.  In contrast, the said virus has become my motivation to maintain my body and mind healthy as a defense against it. I make sure to eat a balanced diet and get enough rest to stay healthy to cope up with the academic demands and not easily get sick in these times. With the prices of essential goods and the demands rising, our family has decided to add more vegetable plants in our backyard. This ensures that we have a direct supply of fresh and free food. When I am going to attend my online class, I bring with me a 2L water bottle to ensure I have enough water to last for the whole day and make sure I drink enough water. To complete my healthy lifestyle, I take a multivitamin. <br>
            <span class="ms-5">Indeed, </span> COVID-19 has tested man’s resiliency. Human as we are, we will always look for solutions to address problems. To keep studying despite the pandemic is a challenge but the motivation and aspiration for a better future weigh heavier than the threat of this pandemic. Physical Education has instilled in me the importance of health with or without the pandemic. We need to be physically and mentally healthy to achieve our goals. <br>

        <p class="text-dark text-justify mt-3">
        <span class="ms-5">COVID-19</span> pandemic has drastically changed our lives in every aspect. Gone were the days of shaking hands or kisses at the cheeks whenever we see our family or friends, learning inside the classrooms, dining at restaurants, and a lot more day-to-day activities we once considered normal. We are now in a new world living life according to the new normal. The pandemic has brought too many negativities for the past five months. News of recorded deaths, infections, hunger, and job loss floods in the television, radio, and different social media platforms. In this trying time, it is important to stay physically fit, have a strong immune system and ensure that we are mentally healthy. <br>
        <img src="assets/pre-reflection.jpg" class="w-75 container mx-auto my-3 d-none d-lg-block">
        <span class="ms-5">I</span> am beyond blessed that I live in a rural area. Food is not a problem because we have a backyard vegetable garden and we are raising chickens which serve as our food unlike in the urban areas that people have to go to the grocery to buy. It allows us to avoid contact with other people and saved us from spending money. Our vegetable garden has provided us healthy foods ever since the lockdown. This does not just save us money but it also ensures that what we are eating is free from chemicals such as pesticides. Along with healthy foods, I also take a vitamin everyday rich in vitamin C, D, A, and Zinc prescribed by my doctor. With this, I can say that I have healthy foods eaten in moderation every day for the past five months.<br>
        <span class="ms-5">For</span> my water intake, I always make sure to drink at least 8 glasses of water every day. This has been my advocacy in PE 111 along with no carbonated drinks which I practice until now. I have chosen this kind of advocacy based on my own experience. I was confined in the hospital for 5 days because of Urinary Tract Infection last school year which was very hassle for my academics. This is due to my habit of less water intake, more caffeine, and carbonated drinks. That scenario has instilled a lot of learnings in me on the importance of the proper amount of water intake every day. <br>
        <span class="ms-5">Since</span> we were advised to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus, I had enough time to do everyday exercise. I have seen a 30- day fitness challenge on YouTube which serves as my guide in my everyday exercise. It was a 15-minute High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercise with 8 different exercises targeting the cores, butt, legs, and muscles. I completed the challenge however I wasn’t able to maintain working out which is I think everyone’s struggle when it comes to working out. Through that exercise, I was able to reduce the size of my belly fat and achieve my fitness goals. <br>
        <span class="ms-5">At</span> this time of the pandemic, we have to boost our immune system. Through eating a proper balanced diet incorporated with exercise and taking vitamins, we will be able to develop a strong barrier system against the virus. Let us help our front liners in battling COVID 19. With this small step of precautionary measures, we will be able to at least lessen the burden carried by our front liners.  As the popular saying goes, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. <br>
